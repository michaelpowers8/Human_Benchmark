# HumanBenchmark Automation

This project automates various tests on the HumanBenchmark website (https://humanbenchmark.com) using Selenium WebDriver. The scripts can perform tests like Visual Memory, Verbal Memory, Number Memory, and Typing with configurable settings.

## Features

- Automated testing for multiple HumanBenchmark games:
  - Visual Memory
  - Verbal Memory
  - Number Memory
  - Typing
- Configurable through `Config.json`
- Detailed logging of all operations
- Headless browser option available

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- ChromeDriver (matching your Chrome version)
- PyAutoGUI (for Typing test)
- Google Chrome browser

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install selenium pyautogui
   ```
3. Download ChromeDriver from https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/ and ensure it's in your PATH

## Configuration

Edit the `Config.json` file to set your preferences:

```json
{
  "Username": "my-username@example.com",
  "Password": "my-password",
  "Post_Test_Score_Delay": 3,
  "Visual_Memory": true,
  "Verbal_Memory": true,
  "Typing": true,
  "Number_Memory": true,
  "Reaction_Time": false,
  "Sequence_Memory": false,
  "Aim_Trainer": false,
  "Chimp_Test": false
}
```

## Usage

Run individual test scripts:

- `Visual_Memory.py`
- `Verbal_Memory.py`
- `Number_Memory.py`
- `Typing.py`

Each script will:
1. Log in to HumanBenchmark using your credentials
2. Navigate to the specified test
3. Perform the test according to its logic
4. Save the score (if configured to do so)

## Notes

- The scripts include intentional "lose" conditions to make scores appear more natural
- Some tests have maximum score limits to prevent website crashes
- Logs are saved daily with timestamps in `Human_Benchmark_YYYYMMDD.log`
- For the typing test, extremely high WPM scores (â‰¥15000) will trigger an automatic save
